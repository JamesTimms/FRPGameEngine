 * It is only with non-lambertian BRDF's that, in theory, we could sample them more
 * efficiently, if we knew in which direction the BRDF reflects the most energy.
 * This would be importance sampling, but care must be taken as to not over-estimate
 * those surfaces, because then our sum for the integral would be greater than the
 * integral itself. This is the inherent problem with importance sampling.

 * The points are uniform over the sphere and NOT over the projected disk
 * of the sphere, so this function cannot be used when sampling a spherical
 * light, where we need to sample the projected surface of the light (i.e. disk)!
